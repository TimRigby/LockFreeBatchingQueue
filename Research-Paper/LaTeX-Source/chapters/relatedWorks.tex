The Lock Free Queue with Batching designed by Gal Milman et al. \parencite{r1} is an extension of the concurrent lock-free queue by Michael and Scott \parencite{r2}. The Michael and Scott queue serves as the baseline for many developments on the concurrent FIFO queue, yet it is not scalable and only allows for one Enqueuer and one Dequeuer thread at a time. Moir et al. \parencite{r3} presented a queue that increased scalability by allowing pairs of concurrent equeue and dequeue method calls to exchange values and eliminate themselves without having to access the shared queue under certain circumstances. This concept reduces contention upon the shared queue, a concept adopted and furthered by the Lock Free Queue with Batching as it locally pairs and eliminates multiple enqueue and dequeue operations before accessing the shared queue. The implementation of the Lock Free Queue with Batching most directly rises from the work done by Kogan and Herlihy which allows for batching of operations of the same type to be executed as a subsequence at once on the shared queue. The Lock Free Queue with Batching improves on the performance of the concurrent queue implemented by Kogan and Herlihy by allowing for alternation between enqueue and dequeue operations within a batch such as would most often be encountered in the general use case of a queue.
